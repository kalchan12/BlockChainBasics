# BlockChainBasics

This repository serves as a technical resource for the BlockChainBasics project, which systematically explores smart contract development utilizing Solidity. The content is structured in alignment with the Cyfrin Blockchain and Foundry Full Course curriculum, providing a rigorous and practical approach to blockchain engineering.

## Project Overview
Contained within this repository are source code, technical notes, and supplementary resources derived from the Cyfrin Solidity Blockchain Developer Path. The curriculum encompasses foundational blockchain principles, smart contract architecture, and advanced Solidity programming, reinforced through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios.

### Repository Structure
- **Section 1: Simple Storage**  
  Introduction to Solidity fundamentals, including contract structure, state variables, functions, arrays, structs, and mappings. This section includes the implementation and documentation for the SimpleStorage contract.
- **Section 2: Remix Storage Factory**  
  Examination of contract factories, multi-contract deployment, and inter-contract communication. Artifacts include StorageFactory, AddFiveStorage, and associated technical notes.
- **Section 3: Remix Fund Me**  
  Development of a decentralized crowdfunding contract, integration of price feeds, and application of advanced Solidity design patterns. This section features FundMe, PriceConverter, and explanatory contracts.
- **Section 4: AI Prompting**  
  Guidance on effective AI-assisted development, prompt engineering, and leveraging community support. Includes actionable notes on AI prompting strategies.
- **Foundry Full Course**  
  Advanced smart contract development using the Foundry framework, with additional resources, implementation guides, and best practices.
- **Screenshots**  
  Documentation of course completion and certification.

## Usage Instructions
- Review each section for source code, technical documentation, and reference materials.
- Utilize the provided Solidity contracts in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or a compatible local development environment.
- Follow the included notes and README files for detailed, stepwise instructions.

## Proof of Completion
Refer to the `Screenshots` directory for official certificates and progress documentation as evidence of course completion.
