Solidity 101 Section 1: Simple Storage
üíª Code: https://github.com/cyfrin/remix-simple-storage-cu

Introduction
‚≠êÔ∏è Welcome to Remix - Simple Storage

Remix
Remix now has the ability to link your workspace with your github repository. The icon is below the search icon on the left side bar (the second icon). This process involves authenticating against an EMPTY repository and setting up the git remote. After completing this process, you can push all your work directly from remix to your repo.
